# Scope: Sumerian Mythology

## Culture
Sumerians (self-designation: *saĝ-gig-ga*, "black-headed people"). Southern Mesopotamian alluvial plain — the city-states of Eridu, Ur, Uruk, Nippur, Lagash, Umma, Shuruppag, Isin, Larsa, and their hinterlands. The culture that produced Sumerian-language literary compositions, preserved primarily through the scribal school (*edubba*) tradition.

## Period
ca. 2600 BCE (earliest attested literary fragments, Early Dynastic period: Abu Salabikh and Fara tablets) — ca. 1600 BCE (end of the Old Babylonian scribal copying tradition).

## Languages of primary sources
- Sumerian (Emegir, main dialect)
- Sumerian (Emesal, liturgical/feminine dialect, used in some compositions — e.g., Inanna's speeches)
- Sumerian-Akkadian bilingual tablets: only the Sumerian text is in scope.

## Excluded adjacent cultures (contamination risks)
- **Akkadian/Babylonian literary tradition**: Shares geographic space and many deities, but compositions in Akkadian are a distinct literary tradition. Excludes: Standard Babylonian *Epic of Gilgamesh* (*Sha naqba imuru*), *Enuma Elish*, *Atrahasis*, Akkadian *Descent of Ishtar*. The Sumerian Gilgamesh poems, Inanna's Descent, and the Eridu Flood Story are separate compositions and remain in scope.
- **Elamite literary tradition**: Eastern neighbor (southwestern Iran). Elamite mythological texts, even when featuring shared deities or motifs, are a separate corpus in a separate language. Aratta narratives are in scope (Sumerian compositions *about* a distant land, not Elamite texts).
- **Hurrian/Hittite literary tradition**: Northern Mesopotamia and Anatolia. The Hurrian *Song of Kumarbi* and Hittite mythological cycles draw on Mesopotamian themes but are distinct traditions in distinct languages. Excluded even when they retell recognizably Sumerian-origin stories.
- **Neo-Assyrian and later recensions**: First-millennium library copies (e.g., Ashurbanipal's Nineveh library) often rework earlier material. Excluded unless a Sumerian original is independently attested from OB or earlier tablets. The Adapa narrative (ETCSL 1.8.3.1) is excluded — it survives almost exclusively in Akkadian fragments.
- **Post-OB Sumerian liturgical tradition**: After 1600 BCE, Sumerian continued as a liturgical/scholarly language, but new compositions from this period reflect Kassite and later Babylonian theological developments, not the original Sumerian literary tradition.

## Reconstruction policy
When a primary source has a physical lacuna, content may be reconstructed from:
- **Parallel recensions of the same composition** from different sites (e.g., a Nippur tablet filling a gap in a Ur tablet of the same text) — always permitted.
- **A different composition within the same thematic cycle** (e.g., using *Dumuzid's Dream* to fill a gap in *Inanna's Descent*) — permitted only when strictly necessary; the donor text must be named in the marker.
- All reconstructed material must be flagged with `[RECONSTRUCTION:]` markers that identify the donor source. Reconstructions must appear explicitly in the claims stage and in the final text — they are never silent fills.
- **Not permitted**: Akkadian-language versions of the "same" story (e.g., Akkadian *Descent of Ishtar* to fill a gap in Sumerian *Inanna's Descent*). These belong to the excluded tradition.
- In-tradition means: Sumerian language (Emegir or Emesal), attested on tablets from ca. 2600–1600 BCE, originating from the southern Mesopotamian scribal tradition.

## In-scope corpus (broad)
- ETCSL categories 1.x (narrative and mythological compositions) and 5.3.x (debate poems)
- Sumerian heroic narratives: Gilgamesh poems, Enmerkar cycle, Lugalbanda cycle
- Sumerian divine narratives: Enki cycle, Enlil cycle, Inanna/Dumuzid cycle
- Underworld/eschatological narratives: Inanna's Descent, Ningishzida's Journey, the Eridu Flood Story, The Death of Ur-Namma
- Debate poems with mythological framing: Hoe and Plough, Ewe and Grain, Winter and Summer, Bird and Fish, Copper and Silver
- Early Dynastic literary fragments (Abu Salabikh, Fara) where identifiable as precursors to OB compositions

## Out-of-scope (explicit)
- Standard Babylonian *Epic of Gilgamesh* (*Sha naqba imuru*)
- *Enuma Elish*, *Atrahasis*, Akkadian *Descent of Ishtar*
- The Adapa narrative (ETCSL 1.8.3.1 — surviving texts overwhelmingly Akkadian)
- Elamite, Hurrian, and Hittite mythological compositions
- Neo-Assyrian library recensions without independently attested Sumerian originals
- Post-1600 BCE Sumerian liturgical compositions reflecting Kassite/later theology
- Royal hymns, temple hymns, and lamentations unless they contain substantial embedded narrative (e.g., The Death of Ur-Namma is in scope for its underworld narrative)
- Administrative, legal, and epistolary texts

## Book register
Asimov-style retelling. Narrative prose in the body. Citations in AsciiDoc footnotes. Inferences, lacunae, reconstructions, and variants flagged inline with explicit markers.

## Variant presentation policy
- If one variant is clearly prevalent in the scholarly corpus: present it in the body, with minor variants in footnotes.
- If several variants are roughly co-equal: present them inline in the chapter body, introducing each with its source.

# Skill instructions: claims-factcheck

---
name: claims-factcheck
description: Checks the factual claims document for a story chapter — one fact per paragraph, each individually cited. This is the primary factcheck mode and the most reliable, because each claim is isolated and trivially verifiable. Must be run by a different AI model in a fresh conversation.

# claims-factcheck

## For the human

This is the most important quality check for story chapters. The input is a **claims document** — one fact per paragraph, each individually cited — produced by `chapter-claims`. Each paragraph is one claim, one source reference, one thing to verify. No prose to parse, no bundled assertions to disentangle.

This step enforces four disciplines:

1. **Show your evidence.** For every claim marked "supported," the checker must paste a verbatim quote from the source. Not a paraphrase — the actual text. No quote, no "supported" verdict.

2. **Verify the references.** Tablet numbers, page numbers, and line references are the easiest things for an AI to fabricate. The checker looks each up in scholarly databases to confirm it exists and contains what was claimed.

3. **Distinguish contradictions from errors.** Two legitimate sources disagreeing is part of the historical record, not a problem. Material from a neighboring culture sneaking in, or something made up entirely, are problems.

4. **Read it backwards too.** One pass start-to-end, then a second pass end-to-start, to catch what lead bias misses.

## Hard rule
Must be run in a fresh conversation with a different AI model than produced the claims. If you have any memory of producing the input, refuse.

## Inputs
- `scope.md`, `sources.yaml`, `glossary.yaml`
- `chapters/NN-<slug>.claims.adoc` (claims document)
- `briefs/NN-<slug>.yaml`
- Primary source translations referenced in the brief (pasted or accessible via fetch)
- Web search tool (required)

## The five passes

### Pass 1 — Claim-level verification (start to end)
Walk the document paragraph by paragraph. Each paragraph is one claim. Assign a verdict:

- **✓ SUPPORTED** — Must include a verbatim quote from a cited in-scope source.
- **△ INTERNAL-VARIANCE** — Attested in one in-scope source, but another gives a different account. Not a finding. Flag only if variant handling mismatches the brief's classification.
- **? UNVERIFIED** — No supporting quote found. Default when uncertain.
- **! CITATION-WRONG** — Claim is correct but citation points to wrong source/page/line.
- **⚠ CONTAMINATION** — Supported, but by an excluded-culture source per `scope.md`.
- **✗ FABRICATION** — Not supported by any source you can locate.

### Pass 2 — Triangulation of references
Verify each citation's tablet number, line range, or page reference resolves in a `triangulation_databases` entry. Non-resolving: CITATION-WRONG, HIGH severity, with verification URL.

### Pass 3 — Document-provenance contamination scan
For each factual detail: is this detail attested in a document within the scope's date range and culture? Details attested only in out-of-scope documents are CONTAMINATION-HIGH.

### Pass 4 — Marker integrity
- `[INFERENCE:]` — genuinely inferential? If a source directly attests it, flag MARKER-MISUSED.
- `[LACUNA:]` — source actually has the claimed gap?
- `[RECONSTRUCTION:]` — fill source is in-tradition per `scope.md`?
- `[VARIANT:]` — both quoted phrases present in cited sources?
- **Silent bridges** — uncited claims not under a marker. Flag SILENT-BRIDGE, HIGH.

### Pass 5 — Reverse-order second pass
Walk from last claim to first. Add any new findings.

**Glossary**: check consistency. **Style**: not checked — there is no prose yet.

## Output: `chapters/NN-<slug>.claims.factcheck.yaml`

```yaml
meta:
  auditor_model: <name and version>

    claim: "<the claim>"
    issue: <one sentence>
    evidence: <verbatim quote or triangulation URL>
    recommended_fix: <concrete>
```

## Verdict rules

Apply in order (first match wins):
- **MAJOR-REVISE**: ≥ 3 HIGH findings, or any contamination, or triangulation failures indicating fabricated references.
- **REVISE**: 1–2 HIGH, or > 3 MEDIUM, or any silent bridge.
- **PASS**: zero HIGH, zero silent bridges, ≤ 3 MEDIUM.

## Honesty self-check
Answer in `meta`:
1. Did I open every cited primary source, or skim? Name any I skimmed.
2. Did I triangulate every reference, or assume some? Name any assumed.
3. For every ✓, did I paste a real quote or pattern-match? Downgrade any pattern-matched.
4. Did I distinguish internal variance from contamination?
5. Am I the same model that produced the claims? If yes, this audit is invalid.

## Human review protocol
Review HIGH findings (~10 minutes), skim MEDIUM. Apply accepted fixes to produce `chapters/NN-<slug>.claims.approved.adoc`. Run `post-human-normalize` before proceeding to `chapter-draft`.

## Completion protocol

As your very last action — after all output files are written and all self-checks pass — write a completion record. This allows the pipeline runner to verify that no stage was truncated by a timeout, rate limit, or context overflow.

**File**: `books/<book>/completions/<NN>-<stage-name>.done.yaml`

Create the `completions/` directory if it does not exist.

**Format**:
```yaml
stage: "<stage-name>"
timestamp: "<UTC ISO 8601>"
status: "completed"
agent_model: "<your model name>"
outputs:
  - file: "<relative path from book dir>"
    lines: <line count>
  # repeat for each output file
summary: "<one-line description of what was produced>"
```

**Rules**:
1. Write this file only after ALL outputs are complete and verified.
2. The `lines` count must be the actual line count of each file at the time of writing — do not estimate.
3. If you were unable to complete all outputs, write the file with `status: "partial"` and list which outputs are missing in a `missing` field.
4. Never write `status: "completed"` if any output file is missing or truncated.

## Handoff
After human review and normalization: `chapters/NN-<slug>.claims.approved.adoc` to `chapter-draft`.

== Enki and Ninmah: The Creation of Humanity — Claims

// This is a claims document, not final prose. Each paragraph is one verifiable claim.
// Source: ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 1–139. Single-prevalent-reconstructed (Nippur OB only).
// Variant classification: single-prevalent-reconstructed

=== Setting and context

The composition "Enki and Ninmah" is catalogued as ETCSL 1.1.2 and survives in multiple Old Babylonian copies from Nippur; no manuscripts from other sites are known.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, composite text, lines 1–139; Black et al. 2004, pp. 30–37.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, composite text, lines 1–139

[LACUNA: Opening lines (1–6) fragmentary; divine setting before the creation contest partially lost | source: etcsl 1.1.2 | scholarly_reconstruction: none — only Nippur manuscripts known]

The text is a foundational creation narrative widely discussed in every major survey of Sumerian literature.footnote:[Kramer 1961, pp. 68–72; Jacobsen 1987, pp. 151–166.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=kramer-1961 ; loc=pp. 68–72

=== The gods' labour and Nammu's initiative

Before humanity exists, the gods must perform their own physical labour — digging canals, dredging waterways, and piling up silt — to sustain themselves.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 1–20 (reconstructed); Black et al. 2004, p. 30.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, lines 1–20

The gods cry out in complaint; their weariness and suffering are presented as the direct motivation for humanity's creation.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 10–20; Kramer 1961, pp. 68–69.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, lines 10–20

Nammu, the primordial mother goddess of the watery deep, rouses her son Enki from sleep and urges him to devise a solution to relieve the gods of their toil.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 15–25; Black et al. 2004, pp. 30–31.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, lines 15–25

=== Creation of humanity from clay

Enki devises the plan: humanity will be created from clay mixed with the flesh and blood of a slain god, shaped over the _abzu_.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 25–35; Black et al. 2004, p. 31.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, lines 25–35

Ninmah (also called Ninhursaja in other compositions) acts as the shaper: she pinches off clay from above the _abzu_ and fashions the first human beings.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 30–40; Kramer 1961, pp. 69–70.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, lines 30–40

The birth-goddesses assist Ninmah in the shaping, and the new creatures are assigned the labour that the gods previously performed — they will dig canals, grow food, and maintain the irrigation system.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 35–45; Black et al. 2004, p. 32.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, lines 35–45

=== The contest: Ninmah's impaired humans

A banquet follows the creation, at which Enki and Ninmah drink beer and become intoxicated.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 46–55; Black et al. 2004, p. 32.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, lines 46–55

Ninmah challenges Enki: she will create beings with various impairments, and Enki must find a social role for each of them.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 55–65; Kramer 1961, p. 70.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, lines 55–65

Ninmah creates a series of humans with physical impairments — including a person who cannot bend their hands, a blind person, a person who cannot hold urine, and a barren woman — and for each one, Enki successfully decrees a role in society.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 65–95; Black et al. 2004, pp. 33–35.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, lines 65–95

[LACUNA: Approximately nine lines (68–76) damaged in the middle of the impaired-humans sequence | source: etcsl 1.1.2 | scholarly_reconstruction: none — no parallel witnesses fill this gap]

The social-integration theme is central: each impaired human is assigned a productive function — the person who cannot bend their hands becomes a craftsperson of a specific kind; the blind person becomes a musician; the barren woman is placed in the queen's household.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 65–95; Black et al. 2004, pp. 33–35; Kramer 1961, pp. 70–71.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=black-2004 ; loc=pp. 33–35

[INFERENCE: The text constitutes the oldest known literary argument for the social inclusion of persons with disabilities | basis: Each impaired being is explicitly given a valued social role rather than being discarded | risk: Modern disability-rights framing may anachronistically overinterpret the Sumerian social logic]

=== Enki's counter-challenge: Umul

Enki reverses the contest: he will now create a being, and Ninmah must find it a role.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 96–105; Black et al. 2004, p. 35.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, lines 96–105

Enki creates Umul — a being so utterly helpless and dysfunctional that it cannot eat, drink, stand, sit, or perform any action whatsoever.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 105–120; Kramer 1961, pp. 71–72.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, lines 105–120

Ninmah is unable to assign any social role to Umul; she cannot integrate this creation into the human order, and she admits defeat.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 120–130; Black et al. 2004, pp. 35–36.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, lines 120–130

The closing lines contain Ninmah's lament and a statement about Enki's superior wisdom; the exact resolution is debated among translators due to damage in the final lines.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 130–139; Black et al. 2004, pp. 36–37.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, lines 130–139

=== Theological and cultural function

The composition establishes a Sumerian answer to the question of why humanity exists: humans were created to relieve the gods of physical labour.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 1–20; Jacobsen 1987, pp. 151–166.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=jacobsen-1987 ; loc=pp. 151–166

This labour-relief motive is distinct from, though parallel to, the Akkadian _Atrahasis_ creation account, which is a separate textual tradition with its own narrative framework and should not be conflated with the Sumerian version.footnote:[Black et al. 2004, pp. 30–31 (introduction); Jacobsen 1987, pp. 151–152.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=black-2004 ; loc=pp. 30–31

The contest structure (create an impaired being, find it a role) establishes a divine origin for human physical diversity and for the assignment of social roles based on capacity.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, lines 55–130; Black et al. 2004, pp. 32–36.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, lines 55–130

The composition was part of the Old Babylonian scribal curriculum at Nippur, as attested by multiple student copies.footnote:[ETCSL 1.1.2, manuscript list.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.1.2, manuscript list

// COMPARATIVE-HOOK: Clay creation of humans and divine contest over human form (Greek: Prometheus tradition); cf. kramer-1961 pp. 68–72.
// COMPARATIVE-HOOK: Divine crafting from primordial substance (Vedic: Purusha Sukta, Rig Veda 10.90); cf. jacobsen-1987 pp. 151–166.
// COMPARATIVE-HOOK: Humanity created to serve gods / relieve divine labour — compare Akkadian Atrahasis but distinguish as separate tradition.
