# Scope: Sumerian Mythology

## Culture
Sumerians (self-designation: *saĝ-gig-ga*, "black-headed people"). Southern Mesopotamian alluvial plain — the city-states of Eridu, Ur, Uruk, Nippur, Lagash, Umma, Shuruppag, Isin, Larsa, and their hinterlands. The culture that produced Sumerian-language literary compositions, preserved primarily through the scribal school (*edubba*) tradition.

## Period
ca. 2600 BCE (earliest attested literary fragments, Early Dynastic period: Abu Salabikh and Fara tablets) — ca. 1600 BCE (end of the Old Babylonian scribal copying tradition).

## Languages of primary sources
- Sumerian (Emegir, main dialect)
- Sumerian (Emesal, liturgical/feminine dialect, used in some compositions — e.g., Inanna's speeches)
- Sumerian-Akkadian bilingual tablets: only the Sumerian text is in scope.

## Excluded adjacent cultures (contamination risks)
- **Akkadian/Babylonian literary tradition**: Shares geographic space and many deities, but compositions in Akkadian are a distinct literary tradition. Excludes: Standard Babylonian *Epic of Gilgamesh* (*Sha naqba imuru*), *Enuma Elish*, *Atrahasis*, Akkadian *Descent of Ishtar*. The Sumerian Gilgamesh poems, Inanna's Descent, and the Eridu Flood Story are separate compositions and remain in scope.
- **Elamite literary tradition**: Eastern neighbor (southwestern Iran). Elamite mythological texts, even when featuring shared deities or motifs, are a separate corpus in a separate language. Aratta narratives are in scope (Sumerian compositions *about* a distant land, not Elamite texts).
- **Hurrian/Hittite literary tradition**: Northern Mesopotamia and Anatolia. The Hurrian *Song of Kumarbi* and Hittite mythological cycles draw on Mesopotamian themes but are distinct traditions in distinct languages. Excluded even when they retell recognizably Sumerian-origin stories.
- **Neo-Assyrian and later recensions**: First-millennium library copies (e.g., Ashurbanipal's Nineveh library) often rework earlier material. Excluded unless a Sumerian original is independently attested from OB or earlier tablets. The Adapa narrative (ETCSL 1.8.3.1) is excluded — it survives almost exclusively in Akkadian fragments.
- **Post-OB Sumerian liturgical tradition**: After 1600 BCE, Sumerian continued as a liturgical/scholarly language, but new compositions from this period reflect Kassite and later Babylonian theological developments, not the original Sumerian literary tradition.

## Reconstruction policy
When a primary source has a physical lacuna, content may be reconstructed from:
- **Parallel recensions of the same composition** from different sites (e.g., a Nippur tablet filling a gap in a Ur tablet of the same text) — always permitted.
- **A different composition within the same thematic cycle** (e.g., using *Dumuzid's Dream* to fill a gap in *Inanna's Descent*) — permitted only when strictly necessary; the donor text must be named in the marker.
- All reconstructed material must be flagged with `[RECONSTRUCTION:]` markers that identify the donor source. Reconstructions must appear explicitly in the claims stage and in the final text — they are never silent fills.
- **Not permitted**: Akkadian-language versions of the "same" story (e.g., Akkadian *Descent of Ishtar* to fill a gap in Sumerian *Inanna's Descent*). These belong to the excluded tradition.
- In-tradition means: Sumerian language (Emegir or Emesal), attested on tablets from ca. 2600–1600 BCE, originating from the southern Mesopotamian scribal tradition.

## In-scope corpus (broad)
- ETCSL categories 1.x (narrative and mythological compositions) and 5.3.x (debate poems)
- Sumerian heroic narratives: Gilgamesh poems, Enmerkar cycle, Lugalbanda cycle
- Sumerian divine narratives: Enki cycle, Enlil cycle, Inanna/Dumuzid cycle
- Underworld/eschatological narratives: Inanna's Descent, Ningishzida's Journey, the Eridu Flood Story, The Death of Ur-Namma
- Debate poems with mythological framing: Hoe and Plough, Ewe and Grain, Winter and Summer, Bird and Fish, Copper and Silver
- Early Dynastic literary fragments (Abu Salabikh, Fara) where identifiable as precursors to OB compositions

## Out-of-scope (explicit)
- Standard Babylonian *Epic of Gilgamesh* (*Sha naqba imuru*)
- *Enuma Elish*, *Atrahasis*, Akkadian *Descent of Ishtar*
- The Adapa narrative (ETCSL 1.8.3.1 — surviving texts overwhelmingly Akkadian)
- Elamite, Hurrian, and Hittite mythological compositions
- Neo-Assyrian library recensions without independently attested Sumerian originals
- Post-1600 BCE Sumerian liturgical compositions reflecting Kassite/later theology
- Royal hymns, temple hymns, and lamentations unless they contain substantial embedded narrative (e.g., The Death of Ur-Namma is in scope for its underworld narrative)
- Administrative, legal, and epistolary texts

## Book register
Asimov-style retelling. Narrative prose in the body. Citations in AsciiDoc footnotes. Inferences, lacunae, reconstructions, and variants flagged inline with explicit markers.

## Variant presentation policy
- If one variant is clearly prevalent in the scholarly corpus: present it in the body, with minor variants in footnotes.
- If several variants are roughly co-equal: present them inline in the chapter body, introducing each with its source.

# Skill instructions: claims-factcheck

---
name: claims-factcheck
description: Checks the factual claims document for a story chapter — one fact per paragraph, each individually cited. This is the primary factcheck mode and the most reliable, because each claim is isolated and trivially verifiable. Must be run by a different AI model in a fresh conversation.
---

# claims-factcheck

## For the human

This is the most important quality check for story chapters. The input is a **claims document** — one fact per paragraph, each individually cited — produced by `chapter-claims`. Each paragraph is one claim, one source reference, one thing to verify. No prose to parse, no bundled assertions to disentangle.

This step enforces four disciplines:

1. **Show your evidence.** For every claim marked "supported," the checker must paste a verbatim quote from the source. Not a paraphrase — the actual text. No quote, no "supported" verdict.

2. **Verify the references.** Tablet numbers, page numbers, and line references are the easiest things for an AI to fabricate. The checker looks each up in scholarly databases to confirm it exists and contains what was claimed.

3. **Distinguish contradictions from errors.** Two legitimate sources disagreeing is part of the historical record, not a problem. Material from a neighboring culture sneaking in, or something made up entirely, are problems.

4. **Read it backwards too.** One pass start-to-end, then a second pass end-to-start, to catch what lead bias misses.

## Hard rule
Must be run in a fresh conversation with a different AI model than produced the claims. If you have any memory of producing the input, refuse.

## Inputs
- `scope.md`, `sources.yaml`, `glossary.yaml`
- `chapters/NN-<slug>.claims.adoc` (claims document)
- `briefs/NN-<slug>.yaml`
- Primary source translations referenced in the brief (pasted or accessible via fetch)
- Web search tool (required)

## The five passes

### Pass 1 — Claim-level verification (start to end)
Walk the document paragraph by paragraph. Each paragraph is one claim. Assign a verdict:

- **✓ SUPPORTED** — Must include a verbatim quote from a cited in-scope source.
- **△ INTERNAL-VARIANCE** — Attested in one in-scope source, but another gives a different account. Not a finding. Flag only if variant handling mismatches the brief's classification.
- **? UNVERIFIED** — No supporting quote found. Default when uncertain.
- **! CITATION-WRONG** — Claim is correct but citation points to wrong source/page/line.
- **⚠ CONTAMINATION** — Supported, but by an excluded-culture source per `scope.md`.
- **✗ FABRICATION** — Not supported by any source you can locate.

### Pass 2 — Triangulation of references
Verify each citation's tablet number, line range, or page reference resolves in a `triangulation_databases` entry. Non-resolving: CITATION-WRONG, HIGH severity, with verification URL.

### Pass 3 — Document-provenance contamination scan
For each factual detail: is this detail attested in a document within the scope's date range and culture? Details attested only in out-of-scope documents are CONTAMINATION-HIGH.

### Pass 4 — Marker integrity
- `[INFERENCE:]` — genuinely inferential? If a source directly attests it, flag MARKER-MISUSED.
- `[LACUNA:]` — source actually has the claimed gap?
- `[RECONSTRUCTION:]` — fill source is in-tradition per `scope.md`?
- `[VARIANT:]` — both quoted phrases present in cited sources?
- **Silent bridges** — uncited claims not under a marker. Flag SILENT-BRIDGE, HIGH.

### Pass 5 — Reverse-order second pass
Walk from last claim to first. Add any new findings.

**Glossary**: check consistency. **Style**: not checked — there is no prose yet.

    claim: "<the claim>"
    issue: <one sentence>

    recommended_fix: <concrete>
```

## Verdict rules

Apply in order (first match wins):
- **MAJOR-REVISE**: ≥ 3 HIGH findings, or any contamination, or triangulation failures indicating fabricated references.
- **REVISE**: 1–2 HIGH, or > 3 MEDIUM, or any silent bridge.
- **PASS**: zero HIGH, zero silent bridges, ≤ 3 MEDIUM.

## Honesty self-check
Answer in `meta`:
1. Did I open every cited primary source, or skim? Name any I skimmed.
2. Did I triangulate every reference, or assume some? Name any assumed.
3. For every ✓, did I paste a real quote or pattern-match? Downgrade any pattern-matched.
4. Did I distinguish internal variance from contamination?
5. Am I the same model that produced the claims? If yes, this audit is invalid.

## Human review protocol
Review HIGH findings (~10 minutes), skim MEDIUM. Apply accepted fixes to produce `chapters/NN-<slug>.claims.approved.adoc`. Run `post-human-normalize` before proceeding to `chapter-draft`.

## Completion protocol

As your very last action — after all output files are written and all self-checks pass — write a completion record. This allows the pipeline runner to verify that no stage was truncated by a timeout, rate limit, or context overflow.

**File**: `books/<book>/completions/<NN>-<stage-name>.done.yaml`

Create the `completions/` directory if it does not exist.

**Format**:
```yaml
stage: "<stage-name>"
timestamp: "<UTC ISO 8601>"
status: "completed"
agent_model: "<your model name>"
outputs:
  - file: "<relative path from book dir>"
    lines: <line count>
  # repeat for each output file
summary: "<one-line description of what was produced>"
```

**Rules**:
1. Write this file only after ALL outputs are complete and verified.
2. The `lines` count must be the actual line count of each file at the time of writing — do not estimate.
3. If you were unable to complete all outputs, write the file with `status: "partial"` and list which outputs are missing in a `missing` field.
4. Never write `status: "completed"` if any output file is missing or truncated.

## Handoff
After human review and normalization: `chapters/NN-<slug>.claims.approved.adoc` to `chapter-draft`.

== Ningishzida's Journey to the Nether World — Claims

// This is a claims document, not final prose. Each paragraph is one verifiable claim.
// Source: ETCSL 1.7.3 (fragmentary); Jacobsen 1987, pp. 56–63; Kramer 1961, pp. 90–92
// Classification: single-prevalent-reconstructed (fragmentary OB Nippur manuscripts, sole witnesses)
// WARNING: Highly fragmentary. Do not over-reconstruct. Note structural parallels to Inanna's Descent but avoid conflating the two traditions.

=== Setting and context

Ningishzida is an underworld god, described in the Sumerian tradition as "lord of the good tree," a deity associated with the nether world and with vegetation.footnote:[ETCSL 1.7.3; Jacobsen 1987, pp. 56–57.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.7.3

The composition describes Ningishzida being seized by _galla_ demons — underworld demons — and forcibly taken to the nether world, an involuntary descent rather than a voluntary journey.footnote:[ETCSL 1.7.3, surviving opening fragments; Jacobsen 1987, pp. 57–59.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.7.3, opening fragments

[LACUNA: The context for Ningishzida's seizure by the galla demons is largely lost; the circumstances of his descent — why he is seized, what precipitates the demons' action — are unclear | source: etcsl 1.7.3, opening columns | scholarly_reconstruction: OB Nippur manuscripts are the only witnesses and they are highly fragmentary; no reconstruction of the opening context is possible]

=== The seizure and descent

The _galla_ demons seize Ningishzida and escort him toward the land of the dead; the text presents this as forcible abduction by underworld agents.footnote:[ETCSL 1.7.3, surviving narrative fragments; Jacobsen 1987, pp. 58–59.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=jacobsen-1987 ; loc=pp. 58–59

The seizure by _galla_ demons follows the same structural pattern seen in other Sumerian underworld texts, particularly Inanna's Descent, where _galla_ demons function as the enforcers of underworld claims.footnote:[ETCSL 1.7.3; Kramer 1961, pp. 90–92.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=kramer-1961 ; loc=pp. 90–92

[INFERENCE: The galla demons' role here is consistent with their function throughout Sumerian underworld literature as agents who carry out the nether world's demands for a substitute or victim. | basis: The galla appear in the same capacity in Inanna's Descent and other texts. | risk: The specific reason for Ningishzida's seizure is not preserved, so the parallel to the substitute-mechanism in Inanna's Descent is structural, not textually explicit in this composition.]

=== Laments of sister and mother

Surviving fragments preserve portions of laments spoken by Ningishzida's sister and mother, who mourn his journey to the nether world.footnote:[ETCSL 1.7.3, central section (fragmentary); Jacobsen 1987, pp. 59–62.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.7.3, central section

[LACUNA: The sister's and mother's laments through the stations of descent are substantially broken; only fragments of individual lament stanzas survive | source: etcsl 1.7.3, central section | scholarly_reconstruction: no overlapping manuscripts fill the gaps]

The lamentation structure suggests a connection to ritual wailing traditions for dying or departed gods, paralleling the Dumuzid lament tradition.footnote:[Jacobsen 1987, pp. 56–58.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=jacobsen-1987 ; loc=pp. 56–58

The surviving lament fragments are characterized by repetitive, formulaic expressions of grief, a structure consistent with performed liturgical lamentation.footnote:[ETCSL 1.7.3, lament fragments; Jacobsen 1987, pp. 59–62.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=jacobsen-1987 ; loc=pp. 59–62

=== Textual state

Ningishzida's Journey is among the most fragmentary compositions in the Sumerian literary corpus; the surviving text preserves only discontinuous passages of what was originally a longer work.footnote:[ETCSL 1.7.3; Black et al. 2004, pp. 280–282.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=black-2004 ; loc=pp. 280–282

The OB Nippur manuscripts are the sole witnesses to this composition; no other scribal tradition preserves it, and no dedicated critical edition exists.footnote:[ETCSL 1.7.3, manuscript list; Jacobsen 1987, pp. 56–63.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=etcsl ; loc=1.7.3, manuscript list

The composition depicts a god's forced journey to the underworld, contributing to the broader Sumerian understanding that the nether world is inescapable even for deities.footnote:[ETCSL 1.7.3; Jacobsen 1987, pp. 56–58.]
// EVIDENCE: source_id=jacobsen-1987 ; loc=pp. 56–58

// COMPARATIVE-HOOK: Galla-demon seizure and forced descent — mirrors the structure of Inanna's Descent to the Nether World (etcsl, internal Sumerian parallel)
// COMPARATIVE-HOOK: Divine descent to underworld with lamentation — Orpheus's descent, Persephone's abduction (Greek) (kramer-1961)
// COMPARATIVE-HOOK: Ritual lamentation for dying/departed god — Dumuzid laments, Adonis cult, Osiris mourning traditions
