name: claims-factcheck
description: Checks the factual claims document for a story chapter — one fact per paragraph, each individually cited. This is the primary factcheck mode and the most reliable, because each claim is isolated and trivially verifiable. Must be run in a fresh conversation with no memory of producing the claims (a different AI model is preferred but not required).

# claims-factcheck

## For the human

This is the most important quality check for story chapters. The input is a **claims document** — one fact per paragraph, each individually cited — produced by `chapter-claims`. Each paragraph is one claim, one source reference, one thing to verify. No prose to parse, no bundled assertions to disentangle.

This step enforces four disciplines:

1. **Show your evidence.** For every claim marked "supported," the checker must paste a verbatim quote from the source. Not a paraphrase — the actual text. No quote, no "supported" verdict.

2. **Verify the references.** Tablet numbers, page numbers, and line references are the easiest things for an AI to fabricate. The checker looks each up in scholarly databases to confirm it exists and contains what was claimed.

3. **Distinguish contradictions from errors.** Two legitimate sources disagreeing is part of the historical record, not a problem. Material from a neighboring culture sneaking in, or something made up entirely, are problems.

4. **Read it backwards too.** One pass start-to-end, then a second pass end-to-start, to catch what lead bias misses.

## Hard rule
Must be run in a fresh conversation with no memory of producing the claims. If you have any memory of producing the input, refuse. Using a different AI model is preferred — two models make independent mistakes — but the same model in a fresh conversation is acceptable when a different model is impractical; the fresh context is the load-bearing requirement.

## Inputs
- `scope.md`, `sources.yaml`, `glossary.yaml`
- `chapters/NN-<slug>.claims.adoc` (claims document)
- `briefs/NN-<slug>.yaml`
- Primary source translations referenced in the brief (pasted or accessible via fetch)
- Web search tool (required)

## The five passes

### Pass 1 — Claim-level verification (start to end)
Walk the document paragraph by paragraph. Each paragraph is one claim. Assign a verdict:

- **✓ SUPPORTED** — Must include a verbatim quote from a cited in-scope source.
- **△ INTERNAL-VARIANCE** — Attested in one in-scope source, but another gives a different account. Not a finding. Flag only if variant handling mismatches the brief's classification.
- **? UNVERIFIED** — No supporting quote found. Default when uncertain.
- **! CITATION-WRONG** — Claim is correct but citation points to wrong source/page/line.
- **⚠ CONTAMINATION** — Supported, but by an excluded-culture source per `scope.md`.
- **✗ FABRICATION** — Not supported by any source you can locate.

### Pass 2 — Triangulation of references
Verify each citation's tablet number, line range, or page reference resolves in a `triangulation_databases` entry. Non-resolving: CITATION-WRONG, HIGH severity, with verification URL.

### Pass 3 — Document-provenance contamination scan
For each factual detail: is this detail attested in a document within the scope's date range and culture? Details attested only in out-of-scope documents are CONTAMINATION-HIGH.

### Pass 4 — Marker integrity
- `[INFERENCE:]` — genuinely inferential? If a source directly attests it, flag MARKER-MISUSED.
- `[LACUNA:]` — source actually has the claimed gap?
- `[RECONSTRUCTION:]` — fill source is in-tradition per `scope.md`?
- `[VARIANT:]` — both quoted phrases present in cited sources?
- **Silent bridges** — uncited claims not under a marker. Flag SILENT-BRIDGE, HIGH.

### Pass 5 — Reverse-order second pass
Walk from last claim to first. Add any new findings.

**Glossary**: check consistency. **Style**: not checked — there is no prose yet.

    issue: <one sentence>
    evidence: <verbatim quote or triangulation URL>
    recommended_fix: <concrete>
```

## Verdict rules

Apply in order (first match wins):
- **MAJOR-REVISE**: ≥ 3 HIGH findings, or any contamination, or triangulation failures indicating fabricated references.
- **REVISE**: 1–2 HIGH, or > 3 MEDIUM, or any silent bridge.
- **PASS**: zero HIGH, zero silent bridges, ≤ 3 MEDIUM.

## Honesty self-check
Answer in `meta`:
1. Did I open every cited primary source, or skim? Name any I skimmed.
2. Did I triangulate every reference, or assume some? Name any assumed.
3. For every ✓, did I paste a real quote or pattern-match? Downgrade any pattern-matched.
4. Did I distinguish internal variance from contamination?
5. Am I the same model that produced the claims? If yes, this audit is invalid.

## Human review protocol
Review HIGH findings (~10 minutes), skim MEDIUM. Apply accepted fixes to produce `chapters/NN-<slug>.claims.approved.adoc`. Run `post-human-normalize` before proceeding to `chapter-draft`.

## Completion protocol

As your very last action — after all output files are written and all self-checks pass — write a completion record. This allows the pipeline runner to verify that no stage was truncated by a timeout, rate limit, or context overflow.

**File**: `books/<book>/completions/<NN>-<stage-name>.done.yaml`

Create the `completions/` directory if it does not exist.

**Format**:
```yaml
stage: "<stage-name>"
timestamp: "<UTC ISO 8601>"
status: "completed"
agent_model: "<your model name>"
outputs:
  - file: "<relative path from book dir>"
    lines: <line count>
  # repeat for each output file
summary: "<one-line description of what was produced>"
```

**Rules**:
1. Write this file only after ALL outputs are complete and verified.
2. The `lines` count must be the actual line count of each file at the time of writing — do not estimate.
3. If you were unable to complete all outputs, write the file with `status: "partial"` and list which outputs are missing in a `missing` field.
4. Never write `status: "completed"` if any output file is missing or truncated.

## Handoff
After human review and normalization: `chapters/NN-<slug>.claims.approved.adoc` to `chapter-draft`.
